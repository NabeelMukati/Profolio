                <p> In my freshman year, I stumbled into Computer Science, beginning with something as straightforward as a random phone number generator. That small project unexpectedly opened the door to something much bigger. Now, I'm working on "Club Finity," an app aimed at connecting students with clubs and organizations on campus, simplifying how everyone finds their crowd.</p>

                <p>Whenever I find some free time, I dive into a new project. It's my way of honing my skills.</p>
                    
                <p>When I step away from the keyboard, basketball is my go-to activity. I'm not aiming for the pros, but I thoroughly enjoy playing. Alternatively, you might find me engrossed in a book or exploring a new café. It seems coding and coffee are a perfect match for me. These pursuits outside of programming help keep my creativity alive.</p>
